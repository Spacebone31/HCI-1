                    Search and Destroy, is very similar to CS:GO. The attacking team’s goal is to plant a bomb (called a spike) and have it 
                    detonate, while the defending team tries to avoid that. Regardless of whether the spike is planted or not, if a squad is wiped 
                    out before any other victory condition is met, the opposing squad will win.</p>
